A lightweight, Solana-first indexing and data infrastructure layer built to provide fast, reliable, and composable on-chain data for applications, analytics, and developers.

This repository contains the core indexer logic, APIs, and tooling used by Hippo and related products.

Overview

Solana Index is designed to solve a simple problem:

Accessing clean, structured, real-time Solana data should be easy, fast, and permissionless.

Instead of relying on fragmented RPC calls or centralized dashboards, Solana Index aggregates, normalizes, and exposes on-chain data in a way that is usable for:

Apps and dashboards

Trading tools

Analytics platforms

Research and monitoring

Protocol-level integrations

Key Features

Solana-native indexing

Blocks, transactions, accounts, programs, and events

Real-time + historical data

Composable APIs

Designed to be consumed by other apps and services

Modular architecture

Easy to extend for new programs or data types

Open and transparent

Built in public, with clear documentation

Architecture (High-Level)

Solana RPC ingestion layer

Indexing and normalization pipeline

Storage and query layer

Public-facing APIs

Optional integrations for analytics and tooling

The goal is not to over-engineer, but to ship something that actually works and scales.

Hippo Token

The HIPPO token is designed to align incentives around the Solana Index ecosystem.

It is not a governance gimmick or a short-term hype asset.

Purpose

HIPPO is intended to:

Support long-term development of indexing infrastructure

Fund RPC, storage, and operational costs

Align builders, users, and contributors

Enable future incentive mechanisms (access, usage, priority, etc.)

Principles

Infrastructure-first

Utility over speculation

Long-term sustainability

Transparent usage of funds

Exact token mechanics and integrations will be documented as the system evolves.

Current Status

Solana-based rebuild in progress

Core indexing MVP under active development

APIs and documentation being finalized

Early testing and iteration ongoing

This project is intentionally moving slower than typical hype-driven launches to ensure correctness and reliability.

Roadmap (High-Level)

MVP indexer live on Solana

Public API endpoints

Documentation and examples

Early user access

Feedback-driven iteration

Expanded program coverage

Details will evolve as the product matures.

Contributing

Contributions, feedback, and issues are welcome.
